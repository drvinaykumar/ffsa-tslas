# Module 2: Historical Perspectives

## Lecture 8: Stupidity in Historical Decision-Making

### Lecture Overview
This lecture examines significant historical decisions and policies that demonstrate patterns of stupidity, exploring how cognitive failures, institutional blindness, and epistemic vices have led to disastrous outcomes throughout history. It analyzes the mechanisms that enable stupid decision-making at the highest levels and considers how these patterns might be recognized and prevented.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify patterns of stupidity in historical decision-making across different contexts
- Analyze the cognitive and institutional factors that contribute to catastrophic decisions
- Evaluate the role of information processing failures in historical blunders
- Apply lessons from historical stupidity to contemporary decision-making processes

2. How do institutional structures contribute to or mitigate against stupid decision-making?
3. What role does ideology play in enabling historically stupid decisions?
4. What lessons from historical stupidity are most relevant to contemporary challenges?

### Key Terms

- Epistemic closure

### Assignment
Comparative analysis paper (1000 words): Select two historical examples of stupid decision-making from different domains (e.g., military, economic, environmental) and compare the cognitive and institutional factors that contributed to these failures. Identify common patterns and draw lessons for contemporary decision-making.
