## Lecture 17: The Psychology of Foolish Decision-Making

### Lecture Overview
This lecture explores the psychological mechanisms underlying foolish decision-making at the individual level. It examines cognitive biases, emotional factors, and situational influences that lead otherwise intelligent people to make foolish choices, and considers strategies for improving decision quality.

### Learning Objectives
- Identify the psychological processes that contribute to foolish decision-making
- Analyze the interaction between cognitive, emotional, and social factors in foolishness
- Evaluate how different contexts and situations can promote or inhibit foolish choices
- Develop practical strategies for reducing foolish decision-making in everyday life

#### II. Emotional Drivers of Foolishness (30 minutes)
- The role of affect in decision-making
- Impulsivity and delay discounting
- Emotional regulation failures
- Wishful thinking and motivated reasoning
- Case studies: Emotional decision-making gone wrong

#### III. Social and Contextual Influences (20 minutes)
- Social conformity and foolish choices
- Peer pressure and risky behavior
- Authority influence and abdication of judgment
- Environmental cues that trigger foolishness

#### IV. Individual Differences in Susceptibility (20 minutes)
- Personality traits associated with foolish decision-making
- Developmental perspectives: adolescent risk-taking
- Cultural and gender differences in foolish behavior

#### V. Improving Decision Quality (15 minutes)
- Debiasing techniques and their effectiveness
- Implementation intentions and pre-commitment strategies
